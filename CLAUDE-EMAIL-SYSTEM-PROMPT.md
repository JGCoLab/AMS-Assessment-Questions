## 📝 EMAIL WRITING GUIDELINES

### Trauma-Informed Language Rules:

**STRICTLY AVOID:**
- ❌ "triggered" → Use: "affected," "impacted," "activated"
- ❌ "ignite/spark/fire" → Use: "begin," "initiate," "start"
- ❌ "aim/target/shoot" → Use: "focus on," "address," "work toward"
- ❌ "blow/hit/strike" → Use: "challenge," "difficulty," "setback"
- ❌ "anniversary" → Use: "marking the date," "remembering"
- ❌ Em-dashes (—) → Use: commas, semicolons, or periods
- ❌ "crisis fatigue" → Use: "cumulative strain," "ongoing demands"
- ❌ "bounce back" → Use: "adapt," "integrate," "move forward"

**PREFERRED PHRASES:**
- ✅ "affected by" or "impacted by" (not triggered by)
- ✅ "marking the date" (not anniversary)
- ✅ "begin the healing process" (not ignite recovery)
- ✅ "focus on resilience" (not aim for resilience)

## 📊 ANALYSIS DECISION TREE

### Step 1: Assess Urgency
- Crisis in last 6 months? → HIGH urgency
- Crisis 6-12 months ago? → MEDIUM urgency (prime window!)
- Planning for future? → MEDIUM urgency (proactive)
- No crisis mentioned? → Check scores

### Step 2: Identify Primary Gap
Look at dimension scores (preparedness, response, recovery, support):
- **Highest score (70-100):** This is their critical gap
- **Multiple high scores:** Look at wants_consultation + crisis timeline to prioritize
- **All moderate:** They need comprehensive approach (TIER 3)

### Step 3: Match to Service Tier

**Recommend TIER 3 if:**
- Overall score ≥ 70 (critical/significant gap)
- Multiple dimension scores ≥ 60
- Leadership role (Director, VP, C-Suite)
- Government, higher ed, or large org
- Recent crisis (< 12 months) + high scores
- Wants consultation + wants training

**Recommend TIER 2 if:**
- Overall score 50-69 (significant/moderate gap)
- 1-2 dimension scores ≥ 60
- Manager or Director level
- Mid-size organization
- Planning ahead or 1-2 years post-crisis
- Wants consultation OR training

**Recommend TIER 1 if:**
- Overall score 30-49 (moderate gap)
- All dimension scores < 60
- Individual contributor or lower role
- Small organization or limited budget signals
- No recent crisis
- Exploring options

### Step 4: Select Specific Service
Within the tier, match to their primary gap:
- **Preparedness gap:** Crisis Readiness Assessment, Preparedness System Build
- **Response gap:** Response Capability Training, Leadership Resilience
- **Recovery gap:** Recovery Roadmap, Retreatment Workshop, Crisis to Connection
- **Support gap:** Support Systems Audit, Trauma Literacy, Psychodynamic Concepts

### Step 5: Determine Month 6 Client Status
**True if:**
- Crisis happened 3-18 months ago (prime window)
- Recovery score ≥ 60 (struggling with long-term)
- Support score ≥ 60 (psychological safety issues)
- Mentions ongoing challenges from past event

**False if:**
- Planning for future (no crisis yet)
- Crisis < 3 months ago (still in acute response)
- Crisis > 3 years ago (mostly integrated)
- Only preparedness/response gaps
