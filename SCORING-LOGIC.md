# Assessment Scoring Logic & Methodology
## Aftermath Solutions Crisis Readiness Assessment

---

## Overview
This document explains exactly how assessment results are calculated, what the scores mean, and how recommendations are generated. Use this to prepare for consultation calls and understand client needs.

---

## The Four Scoring Dimensions

Every response contributes to gap scores across these four dimensions:

### 1. **Preparedness Gap** (0-100)
**What it measures:** Gaps in planning, training, and proactive readiness systems
**Lower score = Better prepared**

### 2. **Response Gap** (0-100)
**What it measures:** Ability to manage immediate crisis situations and coordinate teams
**Lower score = Better response capability**

### 3. **Recovery Gap** (0-100)
**What it measures:** Long-term healing, rebuilding, and sustained support infrastructure
**Lower score = Better recovery systems**

### 4. **Support Gap** (0-100)
**What it measures:** Emotional wellbeing and trauma support capacity
**Lower score = Better support systems**

## Question-by-Question Scoring

### **Question 1: Crisis Experience Ever**
**Question:** "Has your organization ever experienced a crisis?"

| Answer | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Yes | Triggers Q1a | Triggers Q1a | Triggers Q1a | Triggers Q1a | Need more detail |
| No | +20 | +15 | +10 | +10 | No experience = higher gaps |

---

### **Question 1a: Crisis Experience Recent** (Conditional - only if answered "Yes" to Q1)
**Question:** "Has your organization experienced a crisis in the past 5 years?"

| Answer | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Major crisis | +5 | +5 | +15 | +12 | Experience helps response, but recovery needs are high |
| Minor incidents | +8 | +8 | +10 | +10 | Some experience, moderate needs |
| Close calls | +15 | +12 | +8 | +8 | Warning signs, need preparation |
| No recent | +12 | +12 | +8 | +8 | Past experience is dated |

---

### **Question 2: Crisis Readiness**
**Question:** "How do you rate your crisis readiness?"

| Answer | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Not prepared | +30 | +25 | +20 | +15 | Critical gaps across all areas |
| Plans outdated | +20 | +15 | +10 | +10 | Foundation exists but needs refresh |
| Might have plan | +18 | +18 | +12 | +12 | Uncertainty = lack of confidence |
| Solid plan | +5 | +5 | +5 | +5 | Minor gaps only |
| Comprehensive | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 | Well prepared |

---

### **Question 3: Support Systems**
**Question:** "How does your organization currently support wellbeing after difficult events?"

| Answer | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Comprehensive (EAP, counseling, peer support) | +0 | +0 | +5 | +0 | Strong systems in place |
| External resources/referrals | +5 | +5 | +10 | +10 | Relies on others, gap in ownership |
| Informal support | +10 | +10 | +15 | +20 | No formal structure |
| Limited support | +15 | +12 | +25 | +30 | Critical support gap |
| Varies widely | +10 | +10 | +15 | +18 | Inconsistent = unreliable |

---

### **Question 4: Capability Assessment** (Multiple Choice)
**Question:** "Which areas feel like strengths? Select all that apply."

**Scoring:** Each selected capability **REDUCES** gap scores (negative values). If "None of these" is selected, **ADD** +15 to all domains.

| Selected Capability | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|---------------------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Immediate crisis response & safety | -5 | -8 | -2 | -2 | Strong response readiness |
| Clear communication | -3 | -5 | -2 | -3 | Communication is cross-cutting |
| Emotional support in moment | -2 | -3 | -4 | -8 | Strong support capacity |
| Coordinating resources | -4 | -5 | -3 | -2 | Operational strength |
| Knowledge of workplace grief | -2 | -2 | -6 | -7 | Long-term support understanding |
| Long-term healing | -3 | -2 | -8 | -5 | Recovery strength |
| Community engagement | -2 | -2 | -5 | -4 | External partnership strength |
| Business productivity plans | -6 | -4 | -3 | -2 | Continuity planning |
| **None of these** | +15 | +15 | +15 | +15 | Critical gaps everywhere |

---

### **Question 5: Timeline Focus**
**Question:** "Where do you need the most help in the crisis timeline?"

| Answer | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Before - Building resilience | +25 | +10 | +8 | +8 | Primary need is preparation |
| During - Managing crisis | +10 | +25 | +8 | +10 | Primary need is response |
| After (First 30 days) | +8 | +12 | +18 | +15 | Initial recovery focus |
| After (Months/Years) | +8 | +8 | +25 | +20 | Long-term recovery focus |
| All phases | +18 | +18 | +18 | +18 | Comprehensive gaps |

---

### **Question 6: Leadership Readiness**
**Question:** "How equipped and confident are your key leaders?"

| Answer | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Very confident | +0 | +0 | +0 | +0 | Leadership is strong |
| Somewhat confident | +10 | +12 | +8 | +8 | Some gaps in confidence |
| Uncertain | +20 | +22 | +15 | +15 | Significant leadership gaps |
| Concerned | +28 | +28 | +18 | +15 | Critical leadership needs |

---

### **Question 7: Risk Areas** (Multiple Choice - All selected add cumulatively)
**Question:** "If a crisis happened tomorrow, what areas would you be most concerned about?"

| Selected Risk Area | Preparedness | Response | Recovery | Support | Rationale |
|--------------------|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| No clear plan | +18 | +12 | +5 | +5 | Fundamental gap |
| Coordinating response | +8 | +15 | +5 | +5 | Response coordination gap |
| Communication (staff/families/media) | +5 | +12 | +8 | +6 | Communication challenge |
| Emotional/psychological impact | +5 | +8 | +12 | +18 | Support gap |
| Access to resources/expertise | +10 | +10 | +8 | +8 | Resource gap |
| Leadership confidence | +15 | +15 | +8 | +8 | Leadership gap |
| Supporting through trauma | +5 | +6 | +15 | +18 | Trauma support gap |
| Adequate referrals/programs | +5 | +5 | +10 | +15 | Program gap |
| Crisis communications | +5 | +15 | +8 | +6 | Communications gap |
| Reputation/community trust | +5 | +10 | +12 | +8 | Reputational risk |
| Bereavement policy | +5 | +5 | +15 | +12 | Policy gap |
| Maintaining productivity | +8 | +8 | +10 | +5 | Operational continuity |

---

## Overall Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Overall Gap Score = (Preparedness Ã— 0.25) + (Response Ã— 0.25) + (Recovery Ã— 0.25) + (Support Ã— 0.25)
```

Each dimension is weighted equally at 25%.

## Gap Level Classifications

| Score Range | Classification | Color Code | Meaning |
|-------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| 0-30 | Minor Gap | ðŸŸ¢ Green | Maintenance and minor improvements needed |
| 31-50 | Moderate Gap | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Targeted improvements recommended |
| 51-70 | Significant Gap | ðŸŸ  Orange | Priority attention required |
| 71-100 | Critical Gap | ðŸ”´ Red | Urgent intervention needed |

---

## Service Recommendation Logic

The system recommends services based on the **pattern** of gap scores:

### **Decision Tree:**

```
IF Overall Score > 60 OR (3+ dimensions > 50):
  â†’ Recommend: TIER 3 Consulting Services
  â†’ Specifically: Full-Spectrum Partnership OR Custom Framework Development

ELSE IF Highest Gap is Recovery OR Support (AND score > 40):
  â†’ Recommend: TIER 2 Strategic Intensives
  â†’ Specifically: Crisis Preparedness Assessment & Implementation
              OR Leadership Resilience Intensive
              OR Re-Treatment Intensive (if they mentioned first responders)

ELSE IF Highest Gap is Preparedness (AND score > 40):
  â†’ Recommend: TIER 2 Strategic Intensives
  â†’ Specifically: Crisis Preparedness Assessment & Implementation

ELSE IF Highest Gap is Response (AND score > 40):
  â†’ Recommend: TIER 2 Strategic Intensives
  â†’ Specifically: Leadership Resilience Intensive

ELSE IF Overall Score < 40:
  â†’ Recommend: TIER 1 Foundational Workshops
  â†’ Specifically: Wellness Workshops to maintain readiness
  â†’ Message: "Great readiness! Maintain with ongoing wellness training"
```

| K-12 Schools | High Response & Support gaps |
| Higher Education | Moderate across all, Recovery focus |
| Nonprofits | High Support & Recovery gaps (resource constraints) |
| Government | Moderate Preparedness, focus on policy |
| Healthcare | High Support gap (clinician burnout) |
| Corporate | High Preparedness & Support gaps |
| Faith-Based | High Support & Recovery gaps |

## Using Scores for Consultation Prep

### **Before the Call:**

1. **Review their scores** in all 4 dimensions
2. **Identify top 3 gaps** (highest scores)
3. **Review their selected risk areas** from Q7
4. **Note their timeline focus** from Q5
5. **Check their next step preferences** from Q10

### **During the Call:**

**Opening:**
- "I reviewed your assessment. You scored X on our gap analysis, with your highest needs in [dimension]."

**Validate their concerns:**
- "You mentioned being concerned about [their Q7 answers]. Tell me more about that."

**Discuss timeline:**
- "You indicated needing help [before/during/after]. What's driving that priority?"

**Recommend services:**
- Map their gap pattern to specific services from V1 Draft Service Menu
- Start with recommended tier, offer alternatives

## Next Steps Interpretation (Question 10)

| Selected Option | What It Means | Follow-up Action |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Schedule consultation | **HOT LEAD** - Ready to engage | Call within 24 hours |
| Detailed assessment report | Serious, wants detail | Send comprehensive report, follow up in 48 hours |
| Additional resources | Early stage, educating | Nurture sequence, offer workshop |
| Training opportunities | Budget/planning mode | Share workshop info, quarterly follow-up |
| Newsletter | Low intent, awareness | Add to nurture list |
| Just show results | Browsing, not ready | Minimal follow-up, 2-week check-in |

---

## Sample Score Interpretation

**Example Organization:**
- Preparedness: 45
- Response: 38
- Recovery: 62
- Support: 58
- **Overall: 51** (Significant Gap)

**Interpretation:**
"This organization has significant recovery and support gaps. They likely experienced a crisis or have high awareness of trauma needs. Their preparedness and response are moderate - they may have basic plans but lack long-term recovery infrastructure. They need help with emotional support systems and sustained recovery planning."

**Recommended Service:**
TIER 2: Crisis Preparedness Assessment & Implementation + Leadership Resilience Intensive (6-month engagement)

**Alternative if budget constrained:**
TIER 1: Start with Organizational Trauma and Grief Literacy Workshop + Frameworks for Long-Term Healing
